# ml4sci_test

This directory includes 2 jupyter notebook and pre-trained models for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) organization ML4Sciene Tasks.


**Regression on Planetary Mass in Protoplanetary Disks**
1. [hanzhi_tan_GSoC_transit_simulation.ipynb](hanzhi_tan_GSoC_transit_simulation.ipynb)
2. the pretrained model: [transit_classification.keras](transit_classification.keras)

**Exoplanet Atmosphere Characterization**
1. [hanzhi_tan_GSoC_exoplanet_transmission_spectra.ipynb](hanzhi_tan_GSoC_exoplanet_transmission_spectra.ipynb)
2. the pretrained model: [h20_prediction_model.keras](h20_prediction_model.keras)

**Training Data**

Please refer to this [google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Xn1NbH3N5srCNJ64M-VYx1VPpm_6ZoA7?usp=sharing) for the training data for both tests, please note that p_r.npy contains exoplanet period - radius simulation, and is used by both scripts (that's why it's in the main directory.)
